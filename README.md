# Wordlists

## Introduction

This repo contains word lists that I've gathered and polished
from a variety of sources. I use these lists primarily in a generative context,
as productive material for creative output. Words are written one-per-line, 
normalized to lower case (i not I), and spaces within multi-word words have been
replaced with underscores (new_york not New York).

Lists should all be coming from sources with permissive licenses. Be sure to
review the Sources section below for more information on the origin of each
source.

Additionally, please note that these sources contain a variety of words in the
English language and therefore represent a variety of speakers that may not be
sufficiently filtered for direct use. It is highly recommended that,
particularly in a generative context, you consider the use of a filter before
applying any of these lists to your work. I have a set of filter lists that I
use for my own work [here](https://github.com/bnspalding/filterwords)
