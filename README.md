# Wordlists

## Introduction

This repo contains a collection of word lists that I've collected and polished
from a variety of sources. These word lists all seek to represent some useful, 
general subset of the English language. Words are written one-per-line, 
normalized to lower case (i not I), and spaces within multi-word words have been
replaced with underscores (new_york not New York).

Lists should all be coming from sources with permissive licenses. Be sure to
review the Sources section below for more information on the origin of each
source.
