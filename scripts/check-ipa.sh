# check pronunciation files against each other

# For each file:
#   no leading or trailing space in a pronunciation file
#   1 tab should separate word and pronunciation information
#   monosyllabic words should not have a stress mark
#   files are sorted

# For all files:
#   pronunciation information matches (sometimes you don't want this?)
